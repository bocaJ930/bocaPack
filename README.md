# bocaPack
bocaPack is your one-stop shop for Minecraft fixes and tweaking!

bocaPack is composed of 5 individual packs, one of which is a combined pack. So yes, you can download these packs individually if you only want one or two of these textures!

This texture pack will be updated every time we make a video fixing more parts of this game. So, if you want to stay up to date with everything bocaPack, make sure to join my discord!
